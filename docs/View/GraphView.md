# mxGraphView

Extends `mxEventSource` to implement a view for a graph.  This class is in charge of computing the absolute coordinates for the relative child geometries, the points for perimeters and edge styles and keeping them cached in `mxCellStates` for faster retrieval.  The states are updated whenever the model or the view state (translate, scale) changes.  The scale and translate are honoured in the bounds.
